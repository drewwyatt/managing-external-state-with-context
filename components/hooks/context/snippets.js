/**
 * FROM THE DOCS:
 * An alternative to useState. Accepts a reducer of type (state, action) => newState,
 * and returns the current state paired with a dispatch method.
 * (If youâ€™re familiar with Redux, you already know how this works.)
 *
 * useReducer is usually preferable to useState when you have complex state logic that involves
 * multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one. useReducer also lets
 * you optimize performance for components that trigger deep updates because you can pass dispatch
 * down instead of callbacks.
